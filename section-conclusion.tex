\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{section-conclusion}

In a future paper we plan to stress the relation between infinitary $\lambda$ terms
and co-inductive definitions, and to extend our results to a $\lambda$-calculus 
including all Martin L\"{o}f finite Inductive Definitions, and not only
the set $\N$ of natural numbers.

%, and to prove \emph{strong} 
%normalization in the limit if we use reductions which are ``fair''.
%``Fair'' reductions can reduce \emph{inside} the right-hand side of some $\cond$, 
%but they never forget entirely the task of reducing \emph{outside} all such subterms.

In the current paper 
we did not consider the confluence problem for $\CTlambda$. As already remarked
by Ariola and Klop for their infinitary $\lambda$-calculus (\cite{ARIOLA1997154}), 
confluence in \emph{finite time} may fail, because in an infinite term 
a reduction can multiply another redex infinitely many times. Yet, confluence
can be restored in the limit. We plan to prove confluence in the limit for $\CTlambda$,
and as a corollary 
that  each term of $\CTlambda$ has exactly one limit \emph{normal} form in $\LAMBDA$. 
The difference with Ariola and Klop (or with B\"{o}hm trees, for that matter)
is that our limits, being in $\LAMBDA$, are trees with no \quotationMarks{undefined} node.
Confluence in the limit has already 
been checked for the combinatorial version of cyclic $\systemT$ 
(\cite{2021-Anupam-Das,DBLP:conf/fscd/000221,DBLP:conf/lics/Curzi022,DBLP:conf/csl/Curzi023,DBLP:conf/lics/Curzi023}).
 
As a corollary, we plan to prove that each closed term of type $\N$ in $\CTlambda$ 
has \emph{exactly one} normal form, which is a numeral 
and which can be obtained in finitely many steps.

In \cite{2021-Anupam-Das}, Das proved the equivalence between G\"{o}del system 
$\systemT$ and the combinatorial version of cyclic $\systemT$. 
In a future work, we plan to prove a corresponding result for $\CTlambda$,
that the closed terms $\CTlambda$ represent exactly the total computable functionals definable 
in G\"{o}del system $\systemT$, by 
adapting  Das' proof for dealing with the $\lambda$ binder which we added to his system.
