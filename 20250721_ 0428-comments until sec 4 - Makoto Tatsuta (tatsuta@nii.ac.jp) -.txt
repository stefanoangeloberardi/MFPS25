Dear Stefano,

I read the draft dated on July 21 until Sec 4.
I may continue.
Here are my comments.

p.3

2. A term is a labeled binary tree, 
-->
2. A term is a possibly infinite labeled binary tree, 

p.4

if and only if there is a unique phi : Γ → Γ′. 
-->
if and only if phi=1.

The resulting term t[u/x] still has finitely many free variables.
-->
If t is regular,
the resulting term t[u/x] still has finitely many free variables.

p.5

Def 10:
that T is a binary tree of lists
-->
that T is a binary tree represented by a set of lists

If the judgment labeling l ∈ T is ϕ(l) = J0, and l has p children 
such that ϕ(l⋆(i)) = Ji for i = 1, . . . , p, 
then ψ(l) is the rule (J1, . . . , Jp, J0).

and ψ(l) is the rule (J1, . . . , Jp, J0).

Example 14: It would be better to say
Sum(x)(y)=x+y
(It will help readers)

p.9

b = i+1, . . . , n the a-th, b-th named argument xAa a , xAb b
in the conclusion are connected to the a-th named argument xAb a
and to the (b − 1)-th named argument xAb b 
in the assumption, respectively.

b = i+1, . . . , n,  the a-th and b-th named arguments xAa a and xAb b
in the conclusion are connected to the a-th named argument xAb a
and the (b − 1)-th named argument xAb b 
in the assumption, respectively.
(When we use "respectively", we have to be more careful
and insert "and" in right places.)

Now we list the connections for

Now we define the connections for

There is a unique progressing condition which is explicitly stated, 
all others are stationary.
-->
We define a unique progressing condition which is explicitly stated, 
and all others are defined to be stationary.

footnote 3: deleted (because of def 6)

p.11

satifies the global trace condition if its pre-proof
-->
satisfies the global trace condition if some pre-proof

Remark 24. I did not understand the point. I think we can add:

The difference between the rules ap_v and ap_{neg v} is that in the
rule (ap_v), the type A_i of the variable x_i in the antecedent in the
conclusion can be connected to the type A_i in the succedent in the
premise.

p.12

Fig 2: the rule name ap¬v should be lambda
