I almost reflected the reviewers' comments to the latest version & git-pushed.
I'll not update the files until next Friday (a bit busy).

I splitted the Sum example at Sec 4.1 into (i) its well-typedness + regularity part, (ii) its reduction part (newly added), and (iii) it's in CT-λ part.
Put (i) at Example 2.2, (ii) at Example 2.5, (iii) at Example 4.1. They work as a running example. I think it would be helpful for readers.

This change also answers this reviewer's comment:
> page 9: finally in example 4.1 the need for the weakening rule is made clear. Why not present this example earlier in the paper and refer to it here?


I left the following comments. Could you do them?

[Section 3]
> the description of connections between arguments is hard to read and unclear. One of the problems, besides general hardness to parse, is that the scope of definitions of objects is not obvious at all (e.g. u in item 2 is referring to the u defined by item 1, but t is changed to f).
> the definition of connections takes up two pages of cumbersome formalism, it could be compressed and explained more efficiently. Keeping track of explicit indexes and doing the computations does not help the reader figure out what is encoded. Just giving a picture for each rule, showing the connections, would be clearer and would save a lot of space and effort.

[Section 4. After Def 4.1]
> page 9: you say that you believe that global trace condition is decidable quite fast for realistic lambda-terms. What do you mean by fast? What do you mean by realistic? What sustains this claim?

[Section 4.2. The iterator example]
> Example 4.2: I don't see what the equations up to ~ bring, you could just give directly the term for the iterator "it", it is even clearer than the sum case that you gave directly in the previous example. It would be more interesting to comment on whether it can be alternatively defined the other way by adding the last f inside instead of outside, by It=λf,a.cond(a,λx.It(f,f(a))(x))

[Section 4.3. The interval map example]
> Example 4.3: there are too many definitions of i: i is first defined as i=λx.cond(b, λy.i), but then you add i=c( it(x), i(S(x))(y) ), it does not seem to make sense. I suspect you just reused the name i instead of a different name, which is very unfortunate since the reader does not know which is which. Moreover, the definition λx.cond(b, λy.i) does not match the first unfolding in the proof, which is cond(b, i) instead of cond(b,λy.i). At this point I'm giving up trying to fix the example (which I'm convinced can be done, but this should not be up to the reader)

> page 10: in example 4.3, I cannot parse the sentence "We solve the recursive equation for I...". And again, you are very loose with your syntax: \f,a.i does not correspond to any term in you syntax, as well as c(a,l). As I understand, you are using tuples with terms that are actually "curried". Please be more clear about this.



Best,
Daisuke
