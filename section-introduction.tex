\section{Introduction} 
We will introduce $\LAMBDA$, a set of infinite $\lambda$-terms we use to provide a \emph{semantics} for recursive definitions of simply typed $\lambda$-terms.
The types of $\LAMBDA$ are: the atomic type $\N$, 
possibly type variables $\alpha, \beta, \ldots$, and all types $A \rightarrow B$ for any types $A$, $B$. 
Type variables are only used to provide examples of infinite
terms and play a minor role in our paper.

The terms of $\LAMBDA$  are all possibly infinite trees representing expressions 
defined with $0$,$\Succ $,$\ap$ (application), 
variables $x^T$ (with a type superscript $T$),  $\lambda$ (the binder for defining 
maps), and $\cond$, the arithmetic conditional (i.e., the test on zero). 
We will use infinite terms of $\LAMBDA$ as a semantics for finite 
circular $\lambda$-terms.
If we have no free term variables and no type variables, 
in turn the trees in $\LAMBDA$ represent partial functionals on $\N$, 
provided we add reduction rules transforming closed terms of type $\N$ 
in notations for natural numbers.

In this paper will consider two sets of terms: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the set $\CTlambda$ of well-typed terms having a finite notation in
a circular syntax. We claim that they are equivalent to the set of terms in G\"{o}del system $\systemT$ (\cite{GoedelSystemT}).  

\item
The set of terms $\GTC$, satisfying a condition called global trace condition .
$\GTC$ is a subset of $\LAMBDA$ providing a more narrow and perspicuous
semantics to the finite notations in $\CTlambda$. 
\end{enumerate}

Global trace condition has been introduced by Brotherston and Simpson
(\cite{BrotherstonPhd2006}, \cite{BrotherstonSimpson2011}), then adapted
to algebraic terms of G\"{o}del system $\systemT$ by D. Anupam 
(\cite{2021-Anupam-Das}).
Global trace condition provides a sufficient and quite broad condition for the totality 
of a functional. We introduce more subsets of $\LAMBDA$ which are only used 
as intermediate steps in the definition of $\GTC$ and of the syntax 
for $\CTlambda$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
 $\WTyped \subseteq \LAMBDA$, the set of well-typed terms, is a
set of terms having a unique simple type (see later).  
\item
$\Reg$ is the set of all terms of $\LAMBDA$ which are regular trees 
(i.e., having finitely many subtrees). They are possibly infinite terms which are finitely presented by a \emph{finite graph} of $\CTlambda$, a graph with possibly 
cycles.
\item 
$\GTC \subseteq \WTyped$ will be defined as the set of well-typed circular 
$\lambda$-terms satisfying the global trace condition (see later).  
Terms of $\GTC$ will correspond to subset of the total functionals. 
\end{enumerate}

We will prove that $\CTlambda$ is a decidable subset of $\Reg$.
$\CTlambda$ is a new variant of the existing circular version of 
G\"{o}del system $\systemT$. Differently from all previous circular versions of 
$\systemT$, our system $\CTlambda$ uses binders instead of combinators. 
As we anticipated, circular syntax has the advange of writing terms using
finite simultaenous recursive definitions, allows for shorter denotation, while preserving decidability of termination. By introducing a circular syntax with binders, 
we hope to provide a circular syntax more familiar to researchers working in the
field of Type Theory.
\\

We will prove for the circular syntax $\CTlambda$
that reductions not in the right-hand side of any $\cond$ (conditional)
strong normalizes, and that they always reduce closed normal terms of type $\N$ to a numeral. In a future paper we plan to stress the relation with co-inductive definitions, to prove Church-Rosser, and to extend our results to all a $\lambda$-
calculus including all Martin L\"{o}f finite Inductive Definitions, and not only
the set $\N$ of natural numbers.

%, and to prove \emph{strong} 
%normalization in the limit if we use reductions which are ``fair''.
%``Fair'' reductions can reduce \emph{inside} the right-hand side of some $\cond$, 
%but they never forget entirely the task of reducing \emph{outside} all such subterms.

In a future work, we also plan to prove that the closed terms $\CTlambda$ 
(those without free variables) represent exactly the total computable functionals 
definable in G\"{o}del system $\systemT$, using the techniques developed by 
Anupam for his version of cyclic terms.
