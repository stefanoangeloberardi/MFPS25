\section{Introduction} 
We will introduce $\LAMBDA$, a set of infinite $\lambda$-terms with a circular syntax.
The types of $\LAMBDA$ are: the atomic type $\N$, 
possibly type variables $\alpha, \beta, \ldots$, and all types $A \rightarrow B$ for any types $A$, $B$. 
Type variables are only used to provide examples of terms and play a minor role in our paper.

The terms of $\LAMBDA$  are all possibly infinite trees representing expressions defined with 
$0$,$\Succ $,$\ap$ (application), 
variables $x^T$ (with a type superscript $T$),  $\lambda$ (the binder for defining maps), 
and $\cond$, the arithmetic conditional (i.e., the test on zero). 
If we have no free term variables and no type variables, 
then the trees in $\LAMBDA$ represent partial functionals on $\N$, 
provided we add reduction rules transforming closed terms of type $\N$ in notations for natural numbers.

In this paper will consider two sets of terms: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item
the set $\CTlambda$ of well-typed terms having a finite notation in
a circular syntax. We claim that they are equivalent to the set of terms in G\"{o}del system $\systemT$.  
\item
The set of terms $\GTC$, satisfying a condition called global trace condition, which are possibly non-recursive
terms used to provide semantics to the finite notations in  $\CTlambda$ 
(and  $\systemT$, of course). They provide a sufficient and quite broad condition 
for the totality of a functional.
\end{enumerate}
We introduce more sets of terms only used 
as intermediate steps in the definition of the semantic $\GTC$ and the syntax $\CTlambda$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
 $\WTyped \subseteq \LAMBDA$, the set of well-typed terms, is the
of set terms having a unique type
\item
$\Reg$ is the set of terms of $\LAMBDA$ which are regular trees (i.e., having finitely
many subtrees). They are possibly infinite terms which are finitely presented 
by a \emph{finite graph} possibly having cycles.
\item 
$\GTC \subseteq \WTyped$ will be defined as the set of well-typed circular 
$\lambda$-terms satisfying the global trace condition (and possibly non-recursive, as we said). %and regular. 
Terms of $\GTC$ denote a subset of the total functionals. 
\end{enumerate}

We will prove that $\CTlambda$ is a decidable subset of $\Reg$.
$\CTlambda$ is a new variant of the existing circular version of G\"{o}del system $\systemT$. 
Differently from all previous circular versions of $\systemT$, our system $\CTlambda$
uses binders instead of combinators. 
As we anticipated, 
 circular syntax has the advange of writing terms in fixed point style
 and therefore much shorter, while preserving decidability of termination.
Besides, by introducing a circular syntax with binders, we hope to provide 
a circular syntax more familiar to researchers working in the field of Type Theory.
\\

We will prove the expected results for the circular syntax $\CTlambda$:
strong normalization for reductions not in the right-hand side of any $\cond$.
In a future paper we plan to stress the relation with co-inductive definitions
and to prove Church-Rosser, and to prove \emph{strong} 
normalization in the limit if we use reductions which are ``fair'':
fair reductions can reduce \emph{inside} the right-hand side of some $\cond$, but they never forget entirely 
the task of reducing \emph{outside} all such subterms.

In a future work, we also plan to prove that the closed terms $\CTlambda$ 
(those without free variables)
represent exactly the total computable functionals definable in G\"{o}del system $\systemT$, using the techniques developed by Anupam for his version of cyclic
terms.
