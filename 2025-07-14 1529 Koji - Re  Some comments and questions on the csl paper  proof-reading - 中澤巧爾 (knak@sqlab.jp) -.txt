Dear Stefano and Daisuke,

> >     the unique infinite path is up-right-left cyclically, with terms  f, cond(x,f(Sx)), f(Sx), f, cyclically. The term f is left-finite. Indeed, if you move definitively left in the unique infinite branch,  you should cycle through f, but this is impossible, because moving left from f you find in this order f, cond(x,f(Sx)), x and you stop.

In my understanding of Definition 11, the well-typedness of a term
requires that there is no infinite path
that chooses infinitely many left branches. Then, the term f \sim
lambda x.cond(x,f(S(x)) is not left-finite
since the only infinite path includes left-childs at the rule ap_{neg
v} for f(S(x)). At the same time, this
infinite path has a trace that includes infinitely many progressing
point at cond(x,f(S(x)).
Hence, I believe that term f is not left-finite but GTC. Or do I
misunderstand some definition?

By the way, I do not consider it serious problem that GTC does not
imply well-typedness.
I thought that GTC implied well-typedness (and Daisuke also claimed
that :-)), and (honestly speaking)
I couldn't get why we had to consider the notion of well-typedness, so
I just wanted to confirm that it
was not. Now I have got the necessity of the well-typedness. There
would be no problem if we simply
impose the well-typedness to define GTC and CT-lambda (as it is in the
current manuscript.)

Therefore, I believe this work should be submitted to CSL. (and the
example in the section 6.2 should
be corrected, because it is not left-finite and hence not a CT-lambda term.)

Best regards,
Koji

Then, definitively, whenever we reach some cond(t,u) we move to t and all traces in the pat do not progress. Therefore all traces in all paths moving definitively to the left in all forks are definitively not progressing.

If I use bibtex with the bib file, then Latex with the main file I can compile the bibliography. The updated bibliography currently has 18 items.

Keeping track of explicit indexes and doing the computations does not help the reader figure out what is encoded. Just giving a picture for each rule, showing the connections, would be clearer and would save a lot of space and effort.

I suspect you just reused the name i instead of a different name, which is very unfortunate since the reader does not know which is which. Moreover, the definition λx.cond(b, λy.i) does not match the first unfolding in the proof, which is cond(b, i) instead of cond(b,λy.i). At this point I'm giving up trying to fix the example (which I'm convinced can be done, but this should not be up to the reader)

And again, you are very loose with your syntax: \f,a.i does not correspond to any term in you syntax, as well as c(a,l). As I understand, you are using tuples with terms that are actually "curried". Please be more clear about this.
