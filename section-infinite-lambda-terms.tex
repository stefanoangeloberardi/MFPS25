\section{The set of infinite $\lambda$-terms}
We define the set $\LAMBDA$ of infinite circular terms, the subset $\WTyped$
of well-typed terms and a reduction relation for them. They will be used to
give a semantics for finite circular notations for $\lambda$-terms.
Infinite terms are labeled binary trees, therefore we
recall what are binary trees first.
%, and before them the lists on $\{1,2\}$ and
%some related notions.
%
%\subsection{Lists and Binary Trees}
%
%\begin{definition}(Lists on $\{1,2\}$)
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%We denote with $\List(\{1,2\})$ the set of all lists on $\{1,2\}$, just lists for short.
%\item
%If $i_1, \ldots, i_n \in \{1,2\}$, we write $(i_1, \ldots, i_n)$
%for the list with elements $i_1, \ldots, i_n$. 
%\item
%We write $\nil$ for the empty list, or $()$. 
%\item
%If $l=(i_1, \ldots, i_n), m=(j_1, \ldots, j_m) $ are lists
%we define
%$
%l \conc m = (i_1, \ldots, i_n,\ j_1, \ldots, j_m)
%$
%%If $I \subseteq \List(\{1,2\})$
%%we write $l \conc I = \{l \conc m | m \in I\}$. 
%\item
%The prefix order $\le$ on lists
%is defined by $l \le m$ if and only if $m = l \conc m'$ for some $m' \in  \List(\{1,2\})$.
%\end{enumerate}
%\end{definition}

Binary trees are represented by sets of lists on $\{1,2\}$.

\begin{definition}(Binary trees)
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
A binary tree, just a tree for short, is any set $T\subseteq \List(\{1,2\})$ 
of lists including the empty list and closed by prefix: $\nil \in T$ and for all $l, m \in \List(\{1,2\})$
if $m \in T$ and $l \le m$ then $l \in T$. 

\item
$\nil$ is called the root of $T$, any $l \in T$ is called a node of
$T$ and if $l \in T$, then any $l \conc (i) \in T$ is called a child of $l$ in $T$
of index $i$.

\item
A node $l$ of $T$ is a leaf of $T$ if $l$ is an maximal element of $T$ w.r.t. the prefix order (i.e.,
if $l$ has no children). 

\item
If $T$ is a tree and $l \in T$ we define $T \restr l = \{m \in \List(\{1,2\}) | l \conc m \in T\}$.
$T \restr l$ is a tree and we say that $T \restr l$ is a subtree of $T$ in the node $l$,
and for each $m \in T \restr l$ we say that $l \conc m$ is the corresponding node in $T$.
\item

If $l=(i)$ we say that $T \restr l$ is an immediate sub-tree of $T$.
\item
A binary tree labeled on a set $L$ is any pair $\setT = (T, \phi)$ with 
$\phi:T \rightarrow L$. We call $\universe{\setT}=T$ the set of nodes of $\setT$.
For all $l \in T$ we call $\Label(\setT,l) = \phi(l)$ the label of $l$ in $\setT$.
\item
We define $\setT \restr l = (T \restr l, \phi_l)$ and $\phi_l(m) = l \conc m$. 
We call any $\setT \restr l$ a labeled subtree of $\setT$
in the node $l$, an immediate sub-tree if $l=(i)$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Remark that the labeling of a node $m \in \universe{( \setT \restr l )}$ 
is the same label of the corresponding node $l \conc m$ of $\universe{\setT}$.
 
Let $n = 0, 1, 2$. We define an operation $l(\setT_1, \ldots, \setT_n)$
combining labeled trees which we will use to produce tree notation. 
Assume $\setT_1, \ldots,\setT_n$ are trees labeled on $L$ and $l \in L$.
Then we define $$\setT = l(\setT_1, \ldots, \setT_n)$$ 
as the unique tree $\setT$ labeled on $L$ with the root labeled $l$ and with:
$\setT \restr (i) = \setT_i$ for all $1 \le i \le n$.


\subsection{Types, Terms and Contexts}
Now we define our semantics for circular $\lambda$-terms,
the set $\LAMBDA$ of infinite tree notations: first the types of $\LAMBDA$, 
then the terms and the contexts of $\LAMBDA$.

\begin{definition}(Types and Variables of $\LAMBDA$)
%\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}

\item
The types of $\LAMBDA$ are: the type $\N$ of natural numbers, an infinite list 
$\alpha,\beta,\ldots$ of type variables, and with $A,B$ also  $A \rightarrow B$.
We call them simple types, just \emph{types} for short. 

\item 
$\Type$ is the set of simples types.

\item
We suppose to be given a set $\var$, consisting of all pairs $x^T=(x,T)$ 
of a variable name $x$ and a type $T \in \Type$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Terms of $\LAMBDA$ are possibly infinite binary trees, with each node labeled by 
some operation on $\lambda$-terms of arity $0,1,2$.


\begin{definition}(Terms of $\LAMBDA$)
The terms of $\LAMBDA$ 
are all labeled binary trees $t$ with set of labels 
$L=\{x^T, \ \lambda x^T., \ \ap, 0, \ \Succ, \ \cond\}$ such that:
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
a node $l$ labeled $x^T$ or $0$ is a leaf of $t$ (\emph{no} children). 
\item
a node $l$ labeled $\lambda x^T.$ or $\Succ$ has a \emph{unique} 
child $l \conc (1)$. 
\item
a node labeled $\ap$, $\cond$ has \emph{two} children $l \conc (1)$, $l \conc (2)$.
\end{enumerate}
As usual, we abbreviate $\ap(t,u)$ with $t(u)$.

We say that $t$ is a sub-term of $u$ if $t$ is a labeled sub-tree of $u$,
namely if $t =  u\lceil l$ for some $ l \in \universe{u}$.
An immediate subterm is an immediate sub-tree.
\end{definition}
 
Assume  $l \in L = \{x^T, \lambda x^T., \ap, 0, \Succ, \cond\}$.
We  use the operation $l( \setT_1 \ldots \setT_n )$ on labeled trees to define new 
terms in $\LAMBDA$. If $t, u \in \LAMBDA$ then 
$x^T, 0, \lambda x^T.t,\ap(t,u),\Succ(t),\cond(t,u) \in \LAMBDA$ 
are terms with the root labeled $l = x^T, \lambda x^T., \ap, 0, \Succ, \cond$, 
respectively, and with immediate subterms among $t$, $u$. 
Conversely, each $v \in \LAMBDA$ is in one of the forms: $x^T, 0, \lambda 
x^T.t$, $\ap(t,u)$, $\Succ(t)$, $\cond(t,u)$ for some $t, u \in \LAMBDA$.

Now we define the regular terms $\LAMBDA$.

%11:55 22/04/2024

\begin{definition}(Regular terms of $\LAMBDA$)
%\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}

\item
We write $\SubTerm(t) = \{t \restr l | l \in \universe{t}\}$ 
for the (finite or infinite) set of subterms of $t$. 
Subterms are coded by the nodes $l \in \universe{t}$, 
different nodes can code the same subterm. 

\item
$\Reg$ is the set of terms $t \in \LAMBDA$ such that $\SubTerm(t)$ is finite.
We call the terms of $\Reg$ the \emph{regular terms}.

%\item
%We write $\Tree(t)$ for the tree of all chains
%$(t_1, \ldots, t_n)$ with $t_1=t$ and weakly increasing by $\sqsubset_1$: 
% for all $(i+1) \le n$ we have $t_{i+1}=t_i$ or $t_{i+1} \sqsubset_1 t_i$.

\item
When $t = \Succ ^n(0)$ for some natural number $n \in \Nat$
we say that $t$ is a numeral. $\Num$ is the set of numerals.

\item
A variable $x^T$ occurs free in $t$ if there is some $l \in t$ labeled $x^T$ in $T$, 
and \emph{no proper prefix $m < l$ labeled $\lambda x^T.$} in $t$. 
$\FV(t)$ is the (finite or infinite) set of free variables of $t$.
\end{enumerate}
 
\end{definition}

%We use two different names for the operation $\ap(t,u)$: 
%we call it $\ap$ when $u$ is not a variable and $\apvar$ when $u$ is a variable. 

The set $\Num$ of numerals is the representation inside $\LAMBDA$ of the set 
$\Nat$ of natural numbers. All numerals are finite trees of $\Lambda$. 
All finite well-typed $\lambda$-terms that we can define with the rules above are \emph{finite} terms of $\LAMBDA$. Regular terms can be represented by the subterm relation restricted to $\SubTerm(t)$:
this relation defines a \emph{finite} graph with possibly cycles. A regular
term can be an infinite tree. 

%We do not assume implicit renaming of bound variables, namely $\alpha$-equivalence
%because the typing system (given later) does not have renaming rule as a primitive rule. 

\begin{Eg}
\label{example-regular-infinite}
An example of regular term which is an infinite tree: the term $t = \cond(0,\lambda x^N.t(x)) \in \LAMBDA$. 
The set $\SubTerm(t)=\{t,0,\lambda x.t(x), x\}$ of subterms  of $t$ is finite, therefore $t$ is a regular term.
However, $t$ is an infinite tree (it includes itself as a subtree). 
There is a unique infinite sub-term chain, which is cyclic:
$(t,\lambda x.t(x),t(x),t,\ldots)$. 
\end{Eg}

Regular terms have \emph{finitely many} pairwise distinct variables, 
even if each variable can occur infinitely many times in the tree,
like $x$ in $t$ above. Through renaming of bound variable a regular term 
can be $\alpha$-equivalent to a non-regular infinite term 
with infinitely many distinct bound variables. In the example above we can
rename each occurrence of $\lambda x.t(x)$ in the infinite tree 
to $\lambda x'.t(x')$, $\lambda x''.t(x'')$, \ldots, the infinite term $t'$ we obtain
in this way has infinitely many sub-terms $x', x'', \ldots$, therefore it is not
regular, yet is it $\alpha$-equivalent to the regular term $t$.


In order to define the type of an infinite term, we first 
define contexts and typing judgements for any term of $\LAMBDA$.
A context is a list of type assignments to parwise distinct
variables: our variables already have a type superscript,
so in fact a type assignment $x^T:T$ is a \emph{redundant information} for our 
variables (not for our terms).
Yet, we add an assignment relation $x^T:T$ for uniformity with the notation $x:T$ 
in use in Type Theory, even if it not strictly required in our case.

\begin{definition}(Contexts of $\LAMBDA$)
\label{definition-context-lambda}
\begin{enumerate}

\item
\label{definition-context-lambda-01}
A  context of $\LAMBDA$ is any finite list $\Gamma = ({x_1}^{A_1}:A_1, \ldots, x_n^{A_n}:A_n)$ 
of \emph{pairwise distinct variables}, each assigned to its type superscript $A_1, \ldots, A_n \in \Type$. 

\item
\label{definition-context-lambda-02}
We denote the empty context with $\nil$. 
%We write $\Ctxt$ for the set of all contexts.

\item
\label{definition-context-lambda-03}
A sequent is the pair of a context $\Gamma$ and a type $A$, which we write as 
$\Gamma \vdash A$. We write $\Seq = \Ctxt \times \Type$ for the set of all 
sequents.

\item 
\label{definition-context-lambda-04}
A typing judgement is the list of a context  $\Gamma$, a term $t$ and a type $A$, 
which we write as $\Gamma \vdash t:A$.
%We write $\Stat = \Ctxt \times \LAMBDA \times \Type$ 
%for the set of all typing judgements.

\item
\label{definition-context-lambda-05}
We write $\FV(\Gamma) = \{ {x_1}^{A_1}, \ldots, {x_n}^{A_n} \}$.
We say that $\Gamma$ is a context for $t \in \LAMBDA$ and we write $\Gamma 
\vdash t$ if $\FV(t) \subseteq \FV(\Gamma)$.

\item
\label{definition-context-lambda-06}
If $\Gamma = ({x_1}^{A_1}:A_1, \ldots, x_n^{A_n}:A_n)$ ,
$\Gamma' = (x'_1:A'_1, \ldots, x'_n:A'_{n'})$ are context of $\LAMBDA$, then we write $\Gamma \ \subseteqsim \ \Gamma'$ \ if for all $(x^A:A)$:  \ 
$(x^A:A) \in \Gamma  \ \Rightarrow  \  (x^A:A)\in\Gamma'$.
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%$\Gamma \ \subseteqsim \ \Gamma'$ \ if for all $(x^A:A)$:  \ 
%$(x^A:A) \in \Gamma  \ \Rightarrow  \  (x^A:A)\in\Gamma'$
%
%\item
%$\Gamma \sim \Gamma'$  \  if for all $(x^A:A)$:  \ 
%$(x^A:A) \in \Gamma  \ \Leftrightarrow  \  (x^A:A)\in\Gamma'$
%\end{enumerate}

\item
\label{definition-context-lambda-07}
If $\Gamma$ is a context of $\LAMBDA$, 
then $\Gamma\setminus\{x^T:T\}$ is the context obtained
by removing $x_i^{A_i}:A_i$ from $\Gamma$ for all $x_i^{A_i}=x^T$. 
If $x \not \in \FV(\Gamma)$ then $\Gamma\setminus\{x^T:T\} = \Gamma$.

\item
\label{definition-context-lambda-08}
We define $\Gamma \subseteqsim \Gamma'$ if and only if
there is a (unique) map $\phi:\{1,\ldots,n\} \rightarrow \{1,\ldots,n'\}$
such that $x_{i}=x'_{\phi(i)}$ and $A_{i}=A'_{\phi(i)}$ for all $i \in \{1,\ldots,n\}$. We write $\phi:\Gamma \rightarrow \Gamma'$ in this case.

\end{enumerate}
As usual, we informally write a sequent $(\Gamma, A)$ for $t$
in the form $\Gamma \vdash t:A$.
\end{definition}


%We have  $\Gamma \sim \Gamma'$ if and only if  $\Gamma \subseteqsim \Gamma'$
%and  $\Gamma \supseteqsim \Gamma'$ if and only if $\Gamma$, $\Gamma'$ are permutation
%each other if and only if the map $\phi$ above is a bijection. We do not identify two contexts
%which are one a permutation of the other, therefore we will need a rule to move from one to the other.


%12:38 17/04/2024
%15:37 17/04/2024

%From the context for a term we can define a context for each subterm of the term.


%21:26 19/04/2024

%\begin{definition}[Inherited Contexts of $\LAMBDA$]
%
%Given any context $\Gamma$, any $t \in \Lambda$ and any subterm chain 
%$\pi = (t_1, \ldots, t_n) \in \Tree(t)$, we define a unique inherited context for $t_n$ in $\pi$.
%The inherited context is obtained by repeatedly adding $x^T:T$ to the context whenever we
%cross a term $t_i = \lambda x^T.u_i$, while simultaneously removing $x^T:T$ from the previous
%context, if it was there.
%%08:00 20/04/024
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%
%\item
%$t$ has inherited context $\Gamma$.
%
%\item
%Any binder on $x$ subtracts the variable $x$ from the context of its \emph{last} argument:
%if $t = \lambda x^T.u, \cond(f,g)$ has inherited context $\Delta$, 
%then $u$ and $g$ have context $\Delta \setminus \{x^T:T\}, x^T$, 
%while $f$ has  inherited context $\Delta$.
%
%\item
%In any other case the context of a term and of the immediate subterm are the same:
%ff $t=\Succ(u), f(a)$ have inherited context $\Delta$,
% then $u,f,a$ have  inherited context $\Delta$.
%\end{enumerate}
%We abbreviate \emph{`` inherited context from $\Gamma$''} with \emph{context}
%when $\Gamma$ is fixed.
%\end{definition}



%The scope of the binder $\lambda x^T.t$ is $t$.
%The scope of the binder $\cond(f,g)$ is $g$ ($f$ is \emph{not} in the scope of $\cond(f,g)$).

We define the term $t[u/x]$ obtained by substituting the infinite term $u$ for the 
free variable $x$ in $t$, with a variable renaming in $t$ 
to avoid variable captures in $u$. 
We can deduce the usual equations for substitution, which we skip in this paper. 
Substitution of a closed term $u$ requires no renaming, and  in order to use 
infinite $\lambda$-terms as a programming language we only need computations 
involving substitution of closed terms. Renaming is only relevant for 
the properties of the semantics.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%IN THE CONGRESS VERSION I WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE
% EQUATIONS FOR SUBSTITUTION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%In order to define the capture avoiding substitution
%under the assumption of not having implicit $\alpha$-equivalence, 
%we implicitly fix a well-order on variables
%and define the simultaneous substitution,
%written $t[u_1/x_1,\ldots,u_n/x_n]$ or $t[\vec{u}/{\vec{x}}]$,
%namely it satisfies the following:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%  $x_i[u_1/x_1,\ldots,u_n/x_n] = u_i$ and $y[\vec{u}/\vec{x}] = y$, where $y\not\in\vec{x}$. 
%\item
%  $(f(a))[\vec{u}/\vec{x}] = f[\vec{u}/\vec{x}](a[\vec{u}/\vec{x}])$.
%\item
%  $(\lambda z^T.b)[\vec{u}/\vec{x}] =
%  \left\{
%  \begin{array}{ll}
%    \lambda z^T.(b[\Restrict{(\vec{u}/\vec{x})}{\overline{z}}]),
%    &
%    \text{if $z \not\in \FV(\vec{u})$},
%    \\
%    \lambda z'^T.(b[\Restrict{(\vec{u}/\vec{x})}{\overline{z}},z'/z]),
%    &
%    \text{otherwise},
%  \end{array}
%  \right.$
%  \\
%  where
%  $\Restrict{(\vec{u}/\vec{x})}{\overline{z}}$ is the one obtained by removing $u/z$ (for some $u$) from $\vec{u}/\vec{x}$,
%  and 
%  $z'$ is the least variable (with respect to the well-order)
%  such that $z' \not\in \FV(b,\vec{u})$.
%\item
%  $0[\vec{u}/\vec{x}] = 0$.
%\item
%  $\Succ(t)[\vec{u}/\vec{x}] = \Succ(t[\vec{u}/\vec{x}])$.
%\item
%  $\cond(f,g)[\vec{u}/\vec{x}] = \cond(f[\vec{u}/\vec{x}],g[\vec{u}/\vec{x}])$.
%\end{itemize}
%
%Formally we define the substitution as follows.
%\begin{definition}[Substitution for terms of $\LAMBDA$]
%  A set $\theta=\{u_1/x_1,\ldots,u_n/x_n\}$ is called a {\em substitution}
%  if $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ are pairwise distinct variables.
%  It is called {\em renaming} if $u_1,\ldots,u_n$ are pairwise distinct variables. 
%  We define $\theta(y)$ by $u_i$ if $y=x_i$, and by $y$ otherwise.
%  We write $\theta,\theta'$ if $\theta\cup\theta'$ is a substitution.   
%  The substitution $\Restrict{\theta}{\overline{x}}$ is defined 
%  as the one obtained by removing $u/x$ (for some $u$) from $\theta$. 
%  
%  Let $t$ be a term of $\LAMBDA$, which is the labeled tree $(T_t,\phi_t)$,
%  and $\theta$ be $\{u_1/x_1,\ldots,u_n/x_n\}$, where each $u_i$ is $(T_{u_i},\phi_{u_i})$. 
%  Then the term $t[\theta]$ is $(T,\phi)$, where 
%  $T = T_t \cup \{l\conc m \mid \text{$\phi_t(l) = x_i \in \FV(t)$ and $m\in T_{u_i} $}\}$.
%  For each $l\conc m$ in the latter part, $\phi(l\conc m) = \phi_{u_i}(m)$.  
%  For $l\in T_t$, we inductively define $\phi(l)$ and
%  $\theta_l$ (such that $\theta_l = \theta',\theta_{ren}$, where $\theta'\subseteq \theta$ and $\theta_{ren}$ is a renaming) as follows. 
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item
%    $\theta_{\nil} = \theta$.
%  \item
%    If $\phi_t(l) = y^T \not\in\FV(t)$, then $\phi(l) = \theta_l(y^T)$.
%  \item
%    If $\phi_t(l) = 0$, then $\phi(l) = 0$. 
%  \item    
%    If $\phi_t(l) = \Succ$, then $\phi(l) = \Succ$ and $\theta_{l\conc (1)} = \theta_l$. 
%  \item    
%    If $\phi_t(l) \in \{\ap,\cond\}$, then $\phi(l) = \phi_t(l)$
%    and $\theta_{l\conc (1)} = \theta_{l\conc(2)} = \theta_l$.
%  \item
%    If $\phi_t(l) = \lambda z^T.$ and $z\not\in\FV(\vec{u})$,
%    then $\phi(l) = \lambda z^T.$ and $\theta_{l\conc(1)} = \Restrict{(\theta_l)}{\overline{z}}$. 
%  \item
%    If $\phi_t(l) = \lambda z^T.$ and $z\in\FV(\vec{u})$,
%    then $\phi(l) = \lambda z'^T.$ and $\theta_{l\conc(1)} = \Restrict{(\theta_l)}{\overline{z}},z'/z$, where $z'$ is the least variable such that $z' \not\in \FV(t\restr l\conc(1),\vec{u})$.
%  \end{itemize}
%  We often abbreviate $t[\{u_1/x_1,\ldots,u_n/x_n\}]$ by $t[u_1/x_1,\ldots,u_n/x_n]$.
%  For a context $\Gamma = (x_1:A_1,\ldots,x_n:A_n)$ and a renaming $\theta$,
%  we write $\Gamma[\theta]$ for $(\theta(x_1):A_1,\ldots,\theta(x_n):A_n)$ if it is a context.

\subsection{Typing Rules}
We define typing rules for terms of $\LAMBDA$ and the subset $\WTyped$ of well-typed terms.
We consider a term well-typed if typing exists and it is unique for the term and for all its subterms.

The typing rules are the usual ones but for 
%the conditional binder $\cond$, and for 
the \emph{typing rule $\ap$ for an application} $t(u)$, which we split in two sub-rules, $\apvar$
and $\apnotvar$, according if $u$ is a variable or is not a variable.
%$\apvar$ corresponds to an $\eta$-expansion and it introduces a global variable name $x^T$
%for the first argument of $t$. 
%As we said, 
We need to consider apart the case $t(x)$ of application of $t$ to a variable
$x$, because in this case we will also check, using the Global Trace Condition, 
whether the first argument of $t$ is infinitely decreasing in any infinite 
computation. If this is the case, then no infinite computation exists. $\apvar$ is like 
a mark \quotationMarks{to be observed} for the argument $x$ of $t(x)$,
it helps to automatically discover more terminating functions.

Remark that we introduced a unique \emph{term notation $\ap$} for application: 
we write $\ap(t,u)$ no matter if $u$ is a variable or not, but we we split 
the typing rule for $\ap$ into two sub-cases, $\apvar$ for $u =$ some variable
$x$, and $\apnotvar$ for $u$ not a variable. The information included in
$\apvar$ is easily lost: if, say, we replace $x^N$ with $\Succ(x^N)$ then we also 
replace the rule $\apvar$ with $\apnotvar$. 

%We have a single structural rule  $\struct_f$, which can be used for:
% weakening, variable permutation and variable renaming. 
%We have a a single structural rule $\weak$ for extending a context 
%$\Gamma$ to a context 
%$\Gamma' \supseteqsim \Gamma$. When $\Gamma' \sim \Gamma$ (when 
%$\Gamma'$, $\Gamma$ are permutation each other), 
%the rule $\weak$ can be used for variable permutation.
%%Variable renaming for a term $t[\vec{x}]$ can be obtained by writing 
%%$(\lambda \vec{x}.t[\vec{x}])(\vec{x'})$. 

%Therefore we do not assume having a primitive rule for renaming. 
%The lack of a renaming rule is a 
%\emph{difference with the circular syntax for inductive \underline{proofs}}.
%
%The reason of not having implicit $\alpha$-conversion mentioned in the previous section 
%comes from this assumption. 
%For example, if we identify the $\alpha$-equivalent terms $\lambda x^A.x$ and $\lambda z^A.z$,
%the left derivation is a correct proof, but the right one is not ($(z:A,z:A)$ is not a context).
%That is, the proof structure does not closed under identity of the $\alpha$-equivalence.

%  $\infer{
%    z:A \vdash \lambda x^A.x:A\to A

%      z:A, x:A \vdash x:A

\begin{definition}(Typing rules of $\LAMBDA$)
Assume $\Gamma = {x_1}^{A_1}:A_1, \ldots, x_n^{A_n}:A_1$ is a context. 
Let $p=0,1,2$.
%$\Delta = y_1:B_1, \ldots, y_n:B_m$ are sequents of length $n$, $m$ respectively. Suppose
%$f:\{1, \ldots, n\} \rightarrow \{1, \ldots, m\}$ is any injection, compatible with types
%in $\Gamma$, $\Delta$: we assume $A_i = B_{f(i)}$ for all $1 \le i \le n$.

\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%$\struct_f$-rule.
%If $t: \Gamma \vdash T$ then $t[ y_{f(1)}/x_1, \ldots,  y_{f(p)}/x_p]:\Delta \vdash T$
\item
A rule is a list of $p+1$ typing judgements: 
$\Gamma \vdash t_1:A_1, \ldots, \Gamma \vdash t_p:A_p, \Gamma \vdash t : A$.
The first $p$ sequents are the premises of the rule (at most two in our case), 
the last sequent is the conclusion of the rule.
\item
We read the rule above: \emph{``if $\Gamma \vdash t_1:A_1, \ldots, \Gamma \vdash t_p:A_p$
then $\Gamma \vdash t : A$"}.
\end{enumerate}

We list the typing rules of $\LAMBDA$: 
the rules $\apvar$ and $\apnotvar$ are particular cases of the usual rule for $\ap$.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
$\weak$-rule (for Weakening + Exchange).
If $\Gamma \vdash t:T$ and $\Gamma \subseteqsim \Gamma'$
then $\Gamma' \vdash t : T$.

\item
$\var$-rule.
If $x^A \in \FV(\Gamma)$ then $\Gamma \vdash x^A:A$.



\item
$\lambda$-rule.
If $\Gamma\setminus \{x^A:A\}, x^A:A \vdash b: B$
then $ \Gamma \vdash \lambda x^A.b :A \rightarrow B$.

\item
$\apvar$-rule.
If $\Gamma \vdash f: A \rightarrow B$ then $\Gamma \vdash f(x^A) :  B$,
provided  $x^A \in \FV(\Gamma)$.

\item
$\apnotvar$-rule.
If $\Gamma \vdash f:A \rightarrow B$ and $\Gamma \vdash a:A$
then $\Gamma \vdash f(a) : B$, provided $a$ is \emph{not} a variable 

\item
$0$-rule.
$\Gamma \vdash 0: \N$

\item
$\Succ$-rule.
If $\Gamma \vdash t:\N$ then $\Gamma \vdash \Succ (t):\N$.

\item
$\cond$-rule.
If $\Gamma \vdash  f :T$ and  $\Gamma \vdash g : \N \rightarrow T$ 
then $\Gamma \vdash \cond(f,g) : \N \rightarrow T$.
\end{enumerate}
We abbreviate $\nil \vdash  t:A$ ($t:A$ in the empty context) with $\vdash t:A$. 
We write the set of rules of $\LAMBDA$ as
\[
\Rule = 
\{r \in \Seq \cup \Seq^2 \cup \Seq^3 \ | \ r \mbox{ instance of some rule of }\LAMBDA\}
\]
\end{definition}

When $x^A \not \in \FV(\Gamma)$, then the $\lambda$-rule becomes:
if $\Gamma, x^A:A \vdash b: B$
then $ \Gamma  \vdash \lambda x^A.b :A \rightarrow B$.

We chose having $\weak$-rule as a primitive rule, even if $\weak$ could 
derived from the other rules. The reason is that we use $\weak$ to preserve 
regularity of the term, namely, the fact that we only have finitely many distinct 
subterms and therefore we have a finite graph notation for the term.
 
Indeed, we use $\weak$-rule to remove bound variables no more in use when 
whenever we unfold a fixed point definition. Without $\weak$-rule, we would be 
forced to introduce more and more fresh names for bound variables in order to 
prevent variable capture. Eventually we would add infinitely many fresh variable 
names, and this would destroy the regularity of the term.

We say that two rules are equal if they have the same assumptions and the same 
conclusion.

\begin{proposition}[Rules and subterms]
\label{proposition-rules-subterms}
Assume $r, r' \in \Rule$ are no instances of the $\weak$-rule 
and have conclusion $\Gamma \vdash t:A$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% WE CANNO INCLUDE THE weak RULE
% THE ASSUMPTIONS OF weak ARE NOT UNIQUE. 
% This is why weak is taken as a derived rule
Then $r = r'$, and if the premises of $r$ are some 
$\Gamma_1 \vdash t_1:A_1, \ldots, \Gamma_p \vdash t_p:A_p$,
then the list of immediate subterms of $t$ is exactly $t_1, \ldots, t_p$.
\end{proposition}

From the typing rules we define the proofs that a term is well-typed. 
Proofs are binary trees on the set $\Rule$, each node is associated to a typing 
judgement which is a consequence of the typing judgements associated to the 
children node under some rule $r \in \Rule$ of $\LAMBDA$.

%12:55 29/04/2024

%The next definition is the formal definition of proof.
%
%We mention that we will introduce a restriction we call \emph{Almost-left-finite} on proof trees. 
%The restriction Almost-left-finite is used to prevent trivial proofs. 
%For instance, we want to forbid a proof cyclically switching the variables $x$ and $y$ in the context of a term,
%by an infinite nesting of $\weak$-rule (Weakening + Exchange  rule):
% \[
%  \infer[\weak]{
%    (x^T:T, y^U:U) \prove t : A
%  }{
%    \infer[\weak]{
%    (y^U:U,  x^T:T) \prove t : A
%  }{\infer*{}{}}
%  }
%  \]
%Another example: we want to forbid an infinite left nesting of applications, as in a proof of 
%$t_{n}:A^n \rightarrow A$ where $t_{n} = t_{n+1}(t_0)$:
% \[
%  \infer[\apnotvar]{
%   \prove t_n : A^n \rightarrow A
%  }{
%    \infer[]{
%   \prove t_{n+1} : A^{n+1} \rightarrow A
%  }{\ldots}
%   &
%   \infer[]{
%   \prove t_{0} : A
%  }{\ldots}
%  }
%  \]
%These proof trees are meaningless and should be ruled out. 

We ask that all leftmost branches in any sub-proof are finite, say, that no infinite 
leftmost branch made of $\weak$-rules or of $\apnotvar$ exists. 
The idea is that when the main operation in a programming language is application, 
then the leftmost branch uniquely  determines the type of the term and therefore it should be finite for the term to make sense.
%12:54 03/06/2024



\begin{definition}(Proofs of $\LAMBDA$)
Assume $\Pi=(T,\phi \times \psi)$ is a binary tree labeled on $\Seq \times \Rule$.
Assume $\Gamma \in \Ctxt$ is a context 
and $A \in \Type$ is a type.

Then we write $\Pi: \Gamma \vdash t:A$, and we say that 
$\Pi$ is a proof of $\Gamma \vdash t:A$ if:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 
  $\phi(\nil) = \Gamma \vdash t:A$.
\item
  Assume that
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    $l \in T$ is labeled with $\phi(l) = \Delta \vdash u: B$.
  \item
    The children of $l$ in $T$ are labeled 
$
\phi(l \conc (1)) = \Delta_1 \vdash u_1: B_1, 
\ldots, 
\phi(l \conc (p)) = \Delta_p \vdash u_p: B_p
$
  \end{enumerate}
  Then for some rule $r = \psi(l) \in \Rule$ of $\LAMBDA$ we have
  \[
  \infer[r]{
    \Delta \prove u : B
  }{
    \Delta_1  \prove u_1:B_1
    &
    \cdots
    &
    \Delta_p  \prove u_p:B_p
  }
  \]
\item
A path $\pi$ in a proof tree $\Pi$ is \emph{almost-leftmost} if there are only 
finitely many rules with two premises in $\pi$ such that $\pi$ does \emph{not} 
choose the leftmost premise.
\item
A proof $\Pi$ is Almost-left-finite if all almost-lefmost paths $\pi$ in $\Pi$ are 
finite
\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

%
%We can check that a proof is almost-left-finite if and only if all leftmost paths of all sub-proofs are finite.
%
%In the case of a regular proof, we can decide in polynomial time in the number of sub-proofs whether a
%proof is almost-left-finite. Here is the algorithm. Suppose a possibly infinite proof has $n$ subproofs.
%For each sub-proof we follow the leftmost path, after $n$ steps either we reach some rule without
%premises (either a $\var$-rule or a $0$-rule), or we loop. Then:
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%If for all sub-proofs we stop then the proof is almost-left-finite
%\item
%If for some sub-proof we loop, then there is infinite leftmost path and the proof is \emph{not} almost-left-finite.
%\end{enumerate}
%We estimate the computation time to $O(n)$ for each of the $n$ sub-proofs, 
%and the total computation time to $O(n^2)$.
%\\

Eventually we define the well-typed terms of $\LAMBDA$ 
only using almost-left-finite proofs.

\begin{definition}(Well-typed term of $\LAMBDA$)
%\mbox{}
\begin{enumerate}

%\item
%$\Gamma \vdash t:A$ is true if and only if 
%$\Pi:\Gamma \vdash t:A$ for some proof $\Pi$.

\item
$t \in \LAMBDA$ is well-typed if and only if 
$\Pi:\Gamma \vdash t:A$ for some \emph{almost-left-finite} proof $\Pi$,
for some $A$ and some context $\Gamma \supseteqsim \FV(t)$.

\item
$\WTyped$ is the set of well-typed $t \in \LAMBDA$.

\end{enumerate}

%A proof $\Pi:\Gamma \vdash  t :T$ is canonical if all $\weak$-rules
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
% either follow some $\lambda$-rule for a term $\lambda x^T.b$, and they introduce $x^T$ in the context,
%\item
%or follow some $\cond$-rule for a term $\cond(f,g)$, and and they introduce $x^\N$ in the context,
%\end{enumerate}

\end{definition}

Well-typed terms are closed by substitution.

Proofs not using the $\weak$-rule are unique, because the first symbol of each 
sub-term forces the rule deriving this sub-term. If we add the $\weak$-rule, this is 
no more true, but we can prove that the \emph{type} assigned to a term by an 
Almost-Left-Finite proof is \emph{unique}: if two Almost-Left-Finite proofs 
$\Pi$, $\Pi'$ assign two types$A$, $A'$ to the same $t \in \LAMBDA$, 
then $A = A'$.

\begin{proposition}[Uniqueness of almost-left-finite proofs and types]
\label{proposition-almost-left-finite-unique}
If $t \in \LAMBDA$, $\Pi:\Gamma \vdash t:A$ and  
$\Pi':\Gamma' \vdash t:A'$ are two almost-left-finite proofs for the
same term $t$, then $A = A'$.
\end{proposition}

%
%%08:56 19/06/2024
%\begin{proof}
%By induction on the sum of the length of the leftmost branch in $\Pi$ and $\Pi'$. These lengths are finite
%because $\Pi$ and $\Pi'$ are assumed to be almost-left-finite. Let $r$ be the last rule of $\Pi$ and $r'$ be the
%last rule of $\Pi'$.
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%Assume $r = \weak$. Then $\Pi$ is obtained from a proof $\Pi_1:\Gamma_1 \vdash t:A$. 
%By induction hypothesis on $\Pi_1$ and $\Pi'$ we conclude that $A = A'$.

%\item
%Assume $r \not = \weak$ and $r' = \weak$. 
%Then $\Pi'$ is obtained from a proof $\Pi'_1:\Gamma_1 \vdash t:A$. 
%By induction hypothesis on $\Pi$ and $\Pi'_1$ we conclude that $A = A'$.
%
%\item
%Assume  $r \not = \weak$ and $r' \not = \weak$. Then both $r$ and $r'$ are the typing rule for

%$h=0,1,2$ the proof $\Pi$ has premises $\Pi_1, \ldots, \Pi_h$
%and the proof $\Pi'$ has premises $\Pi'_1, \ldots, \Pi'_h$ (for the same $h$). 
%We distinguish one case for each constructor.

%\item
%Assume $t = f(u)$. Then $r=r'=\ap$-rule and $\Pi_1:\Gamma \vdash f:U \rightarrow A$
%and $\Pi_2:\Gamma' \vdash f:U' \rightarrow A'$. By induction hypothesis on $\Pi_1$ and
%$\Pi'_1$ we deduce that $(U \rightarrow A) = (U' \rightarrow A')$, in particular that $A = A'$.
%
%\item
%Assume $t = \lambda x^T.b$. Then $r=r'=\lambda$-rule and 
%$\Pi_1:\Gamma \vdash b:B$
%and $\Pi_2:\Gamma' \vdash b:B'$. By induction hypothesis on $\Pi_1$ and
%$\Pi'_1$ we deduce that $B=B'$, in particular that $A = T \rightarrow B = T \rightarrow B' = A'$.
%
%\item
%Assume $t = \cond(f,g)$. Then $r=r'=\cond$-rule and $\Pi_1:\Gamma \vdash f:A$

%
%We provide some examples of well-typed and not well-typed terms.

%Some term in $\LAMBDA$ has no type, like the application $0(0)$ of the non-function $0$. 
%
%\begin{Eg}
%We provide a term in $\LAMBDA$ having more than one type.
%Let $t=u(0)$ and $u=\cond(t,u)$. $t$ has an infinite lefmost branch $t,u,t,u, \ldots$, therefore

%Unicity fails and we can prove $\vdash t:A$ for all types $A \in \Type$.

%A term with at least two types has the leftmost branch infinite, as it is the case for $t$ above.

%
%\emph{Claim (existence of a polynomial-time typing algorithm)}.
%We claim without proof that if a term $t$ is regular then we can decide if an almost-left-finite proof

%then at least one of almost-left-finite proofs is regular and we can compute it. 
%We first check whether the term is almost-left-finite in time $O(n^2)$. If it is not we reject the term.
%Otherwise we start the standard recursive typing algorithm, until a type has been inferred consistently
%for each of the finitely many subterms, or some type inconsistency has been found.
%In the first case we accept the term and we return the time, in the second case we reject the term
%and we return no type.

\subsection{Reduction Rules}
Our goal is to provide a set of well-formed term for $\LAMBDA$ and interpret 
them as partial functionals, a semantics for circular $\lambda$-terms.
Some terms of $\LAMBDA$, those satisfying the global trace condition 
(to be introduced later) will denote a simple and broad subset of the total 
functionals. Our first step is to provide reduction rules for $\LAMBDA$.

%18:14 27/03/2024


\begin{definition}(Reduction Rules for $\LAMBDA$)
Assume $a,b,f,g,t,u \in \LAMBDA$.
\begin{enumerate}

\item
$\reduces_\beta$: $(\lambda x^A.b)(a) \reduces_\beta b[a/x]$

\item 
$\reduces_\cond$: $\cond(f,g)(0) \reduces_\cond f$ and
$\cond(f,g)(\Succ (t)) \reduces_\cond g(t)$.

\item
$\reduces$ is the contraction of one $\beta$ or $\cond$ redex anywhere
in the term, namely, it is the context closure of $\reduces_\beta$ and 
$\reduces_\cond$.

\item
$\reduces^*$ is the reflexive and 
transitive closure of $\reduces$ (zero or more reductions).

\item
$\reduces^{+}$ is the 
transitive closure of $\reduces$ (one or more reductions).

\item
$a \sim b$ is the existence of a common reduct: 
$\exists c \in \LAMBDA. (a \reduces^* c) \wedge (b \reduces^* c)$.

\item
The $\cond$-depth of a node $l=(i_1, \ldots, i_n) \in t$ is the number of $1 \le h < 
n$ such that $(i_1, \ldots, i_h)$ has label $\cond$ and $i_{h+1} = 2$: 
the number of $\cond$ such that $l$ occurs in the right-hand-side of such $\cond$.

\item
The $n$-safe level of $t$ is the set of nodes of $t$ of depth $\le n$.

\item
We say that $t \nsafeReduces{n} u$, or that $t$ $n$-safely reduces to $u$,  
if we reduce $t$ to $u$ by contracting a single redex in the $n$-safe level of $t$ 
(i.e. of $\cond$-depth $\le n$).
%We call \emph{unsafe} a reduction inside any $\cond(f,g)$.

\item
A term is $n$-safe-normal if all its redexes (if any) have $\cond$-depth $>n$.
\end{enumerate}
We abbreviate \quotationMarks{$t$ is $0$-safe normal} 
with just \quotationMarks{$t$ is safe normal}.
\end{definition}

%09:19 24/04/2024
%14:00 29/04/2024

\begin{Eg}
Let $u = \cond. (0, (\lambda z.u)(z) )$, where we omitted the type superscript
$\N$ of $z$. Then $u$ is $0$-safe-normal (safe normal for short), 
because all redexes in $u$ are of the form  $(\lambda z.u)(z)$ and are in the right-
hand-side of a $\cond$. However $u$ has infinitely many nodes which are $\beta$-
redexes. Indeed, the tree form of $u$ has the following branch:
\begin{center}
  $u$, 
  \quad
  $(\lambda z.u)(z)$, 
  \quad
  $\lambda z.u$, 
 \quad
  $u$, 
 \quad $\ldots$
\end{center}
This branch is cyclic, is infinite,
and it includes infinitely many $\beta$-redexes, all equal to the same term $(\lambda z.u)(z)$. It takes infinitely many $\beta$-reductions to normalize $t$.
Strictly speaking, $u$ has no normal form.
\end{Eg}

Through branches crossing the right-hand-side
of some $\cond$ we will-express fixed-point equations.
Reductions on fixed-point equations can easily loop.
However, in order to produce the output of a computation we only need 
to reduce closed terms of type $\N$ to a numeral. 
We will define a set $\CTlambda$ of finite graph notations for terms of 
$\LAMBDA$ and prove that if we repeat $0$-safe reductions 
(those in the the right-hand-side of \emph{no} $\cond$) on any
closed term of type $\N$ of $\CTlambda$ eventually we obtain a numeral. 
We also prove that $0$-safe reductions strongly normalize on \emph{any} term
of $\CTlambda$. 

%14:11 25/03/2025

\begin{Eg}
This is an example of $0$-safe-reductions from a term $v(n)$ to a normal form. 
Assume $n \in \Num$ is any numeral and $v = \cond(1, v)$. There are only finitely 
many reductions from $v(n)$, and they are all $0$-safe. $v(n)$ $\cond$-reduces to 
$v(n-1)$, then we loop: $v(n-1)$ $\cond$-reduces to $v(n-2)$ and so forth.
After $n$ $\cond$-reductions we get $v(0)$. With one last $\cond$-reduction we 
get $1$ and we stop. Thus, the term $v(n)$ strongly normalizes to $1$ in $(n+1)$steps, in fact $v(n)$ has a unique reduction path,
having length $(n+1)$ and terminating in $1$. The final output is 
independent from $n$.
\end{Eg}

We will exhibit meaningful terms of $\CTlambda$ without a normal form. 
However, for those terms we can get as close as we want to a normal form.
For instance, we will prove that for all $n \in \N$, 
all terms have some $n$-safe normal form, that is, 
with no redexes of $\cond$-depth $\le n$. 
%The $n$-safe normal form of a term is unique up $n$-safe equality: 
%any two $n$-safe normal forms have the same $n$-safe level, 
%though they may be different in some level of $\cond$-depth $>n$.

We will also prove that terms have a limit normal form, 
obtained by applying $0$-safe reductions until possible, then 
$1$-safe normal forms until possible and so forth.
%, and that this limit normal form is unique.
