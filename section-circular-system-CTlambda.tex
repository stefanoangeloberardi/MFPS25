We introduce  a condition call \emph{global trace condition} for any proof 
$\Pi$ that the term $t$ is well-typed.
Then we define $\GTC$ as the set of well-typed terms 
$t \in \LAMBDA$ satisfying the global trace condition for some proof 
$\Pi$ that the term $t$ is well-typed. 
$\GTC$ is a set of total functionals. We use $\GTC$
as a semantics for the set $\CTlambda$ of circular $\lambda$-terms 
which in turn we will define as finite graphs.

$\CTlambda$ will be the set of regular terms of $\GTC$. 
$\CTlambda$ is a decidable subset of the set of well-typed graph notations.
For the terms of $\CTlambda$ we will prove strong normalization 
%, church-rosser for the \quotationMarks{safe} part of a term, 
and the fact that every closed normal term of type
$\N$ is a numeral. 
As a consequence, all terms $\CTlambda$ will be interpreted as total functionals. 
\\

From the $\N$-argument connection we now define the global trace condition and 
the set of terms $\GTC$  and $\CTlambda$.

\begin{definition}[$\GTC$ and $\CTlambda$]
\label{definition-global-trace-condition}
%\mbox{}
% \linebreak 
Assume $\tau =( (k_m,t_m), \ldots, (k_n,t_n), \ldots)$ 
is a trace of a path $\pi = (t_1, \ldots, t_n, \ldots)$ of $t \in \WTyped$. 
Assume $i=m,\ldots, n$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$\tau$ is progressing in $i$ if $t_i=\cond(f,g)$ for some $f$, $g$,
and $k_i$ is the index of the first \emph{unnamed} argument the $\cond$-rule, 
otherwise $\tau$ is not progressing in $i$.

\item
$t$ satisfies the global trace condition if $t \in \WTyped$
and for some typing proof $\Pi$,
of $t$, for all infinite paths $\pi$ of $t$ in $\Pi$,
there is some infinitely progressing path $\tau$ in $\pi$.
$\GTC$ is the set of well-typed terms $t \in \LAMBDA$ 
satisfying the global trace condition.

\item
$\CTlambda = \GTC \cap \Reg$: the cyclic $\lambda$-terms of 
$\CTlambda$ are all well-typed terms which are regular trees 
(having finitely many subtrees), 
and which satisfy the global trace condition.

\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Global trace is decidable in polynomial space in $t$. 
We believe that the global trace condition is decidable quite fast
for realistic $\lambda$-terms. 

%Another nice feature of the global trace condition is 
%that for $t \in \GTC$ we require that for any proof $\Pi:\Gamma \prove t:A$ 
%all infinite paths have some infinite progressing trace. This proof is almost-
%left-finite, because all leftmost paths from any subterm of $t$ 
%have no progress point and 
%therefore are finite.  We conclude that if $t \in \GTC \subseteq \WTyped$
%then we can assign a unique type to $t$ with a unique proof, which is almost-left-
%finite.

We include now some examples of  terms in $\CTlambda$, i.e., 
of cyclic $\lambda$-terms. We recall that they have to satisfy $\GTC$, therefore they are almost-left-finite, and by definition of $\CTlambda$ they also are regular.

\subsection{The sum map}

A first example of term of  $\CTlambda$. 
We provide an infinite regular term $\Sum$ computing the sum on $\N$.
In this example, the type superscript $\N$ of variables $x^\N$, $z^\N$ is omitted.

\begin{Eg}
\label{example-sum}
We set $\Sum = \lambda x.\cond(x,\lambda z.\Succ(\Sum(x)(z)))$.
$\Sum$ is a regular term because it has finitely many subterms: 
\begin{center}
  $\Sum$,
  \quad
  $\cond(x,\lambda z.\Succ(\Sum(x)(z)))$,
  \quad
  $x$,
  \quad
  $\lambda z.\Succ(\Sum(x)(z))$,
 \quad
  $\Succ(\Sum(x)(z))$,
  \quad
  $\Sum(x)(z)$,
  \quad
  $\Sum(x)$,
  \quad
   z
\end{center}
$\Sum$ is well-typed by the following derivation, in which we have a back edge 
from the  $\golddagger$ in the top to the $\golddagger$ in the bottom. 
\footnote{Remark that without the $\weak$-rule, the context of the top
$\golddagger$ would be $x^\N, y^\N$ while the context of the 
bottom $\golddagger$ would be $\emptyset$. Without the $\weak$-rule, the proof would not be correct.}
\[
\infer[\lambda]{
  \vdash \Sum:\N, 
  %\goldN 
  \goldN
  \rightarrow \N 
   \quad (\golddagger)
}{
  \infer[\cond]{
    x : \N \vdash 
    \cond(x,\lambda z.\Succ(\Sum(x)(z))): \goldN \rightarrow \N
     \quad (\goldspadesuit)
  }{
    \infer[\var]{
      x : \N \vdash x : \N
    }{}
    &
    \infer[\lambda]{
      x:\N \vdash \lambda z.\Succ(\Sum(x)(z)): \goldN \rightarrow \N  
      %\quad (\goldspadesuit)
    }{
      \infer[\Succ]{
        x:\N, z : \goldN 
        \vdash \Succ(\Sum(x)(z)): \N  
        % \quad (\goldspadesuit)
      }{
        \infer[\apvar]{
          x:\N, z : \goldN 
          \vdash \Sum(x)(z): \N
        }{
          \infer[\apvar]{
            x:\N,  z : \N
            \vdash \Sum(x): \goldN \rightarrow \N
          }{
            \infer[\weak]{
              x:\N,  z : \N
              \vdash \Sum: \N, \goldN \rightarrow  \N
            }{
              \infer*{\vdash \Sum: \N, \goldN \rightarrow \N 
                \quad (\golddagger)}{}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
\]
\end{Eg}

We %colored in \bfColor{oldgold}{old gold} one sequence of atoms $\goldN$:
outlined one sequence of atoms with $\goldN$. The outlined trace is the unique 
infinite trace, it is cyclic and it is infinitely progressing.
We marked $\goldspadesuit$ the only progress point of the only infinite trace.
The progress point is repeated infinitely many times in the unique infinite trace,
therefore $\Sum \in \CTlambda$.

\subsection{The Iterator}

\begin{Eg}
We define a term $\Iter$ of  $\CTlambda$ computing the iteration of maps on $\N$.
The term $\Iter$ is a normal term of type $(\N \rightarrow \N), \N,\N \rightarrow \N$ such that
$\Iter(f,a,n)=f^n(a)$ for all numeral $n \in \Num$. 
We have to solve the equations:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
$\Iter(f,a,0) \sim a$ 
\item
$\Iter(f,a,\Succ (t)) \sim f(\Iter(f,a,t))$
\end{enumerate}

where $f$, $a$ abbreviate $f^{\N\rightarrow\N}$ and $a^\N$.
We solve them with $\Iter = \lambda f, a.\iter$
where 
$$
\iter = \cond (a, \lambda x.f(\iter(x))):\N \rightarrow \N
$$ 
is a term in the context $\Gamma = (f:\N \rightarrow \N, a:\N)$.
\end{Eg}

\begin{proposition}
$\Iter \in \Reg \cap \WTyped \cap \GTC = \CTlambda$.
\end{proposition}

%\begin{proof}
%The term $\Iter$ is well-typed and regular by definition. 
%We check the global trace condition. 
%\\
%We follow the unique infinite trace $\tau$ of the last unnamed argument $\N$ of $\Iter$ 
%in the unique infinite path $\pi$ of $\Iter$. 
%The trace $\tau$ moves from  $\Iter = \lambda f. \lambda a.\iter$
% to the first unnamed argument of the sub-term $\lambda a.\iter$, 
%then to $a:\N$ in the context of $\iter = \cond (a, \lambda x.f(\iter(x)))$.
%Then the infinite path $\pi$ and moves in this order to:
% $\lambda x.f(\iter(x))$, $f(\iter(x))$, $ \iter(x)$, $\iter$
%In the meanwhile, $\tau$ progresses from $\cond$ to the second argument $\lambda x.f(\iter(x))$
%of $\cond$, then moves to $x$ in the context of $f(\iter(x))$,
%then to $x$ in the context $\iter(x)$, and eventually to $x$ in the context of $\iter$.
%%10:30 24/03/24
%In this moment the infinite path $\pi$ loops from $\iter$ to $\iter$. At each loop the trace $\tau$ 
%progresses once. We conclude that $\tau$ infinitely progresses.
%\end{proof}

The proof above includes a type inference from the term $\iter$ to itself.
We draw the type inference in the picture below and we outline the unique
infinite trace. We have a back edge from the 
$\golddagger$ on the top to the $\golddagger$ in the bottom.
We mark $\goldspadesuit$ the only progress point, which is cyclically repeated in 
the unique infinite trace. We abbreviate $\Gamma = (f:\N \rightarrow \N, a:\N)$.

\subsection{The Interval Map}
A third example. We simulate lists with two variables $\nil:\alpha$ and 
$\cons:\N,\alpha \rightarrow \alpha$. We recursively define a notation for lists by $[]=\nil$,
$a @ l=\cons(a,l)$ and $[a,\vec{a}] = a @ [\vec{a}]$. We add no elimination rules for lists, though,
only the variables $\nil$ and $\cons$. Elimination rules are not required in our example.

\begin{Eg}
We will define a term $\Interval$ with one argument $f:\N \rightarrow \N$ and three argument
$a,x,y:\N$ (we skip all type superscripts), such that 
\[
\Interval(f,a,n,m) \  \sim \ [f^n(a), f^{n+1}(a), \ldots, f^{n+m}(a)] \  : \ \alpha
\]
for all numeral $n,m \in \Num$. 
We have to solve the recursive equations 
\begin{center}
  $\Interval(f,a,n,0) \sim [f^n(a)]$
  \quad
  and
  \quad
  $\Interval(f,a,n,\Succ (m))  \sim f^n(a) @ \Interval(f,a,\Succ(n),m)$.
\end{center}
Assume $\iter = \cond (a, \lambda x.f(\iter(x))):\N \rightarrow \N$ is the term
in the context $\Gamma = \Sigma,(f:\N \rightarrow \N, a:\N)$, where
$\Sigma = (\nil:\alpha, \cons:\N,\alpha \rightarrow \N)$
and
$(f:\N\rightarrow\N, a:\N)$ is the context defined 
in the previous sub-section. In particular, $\iter(n) \sim f^n(a)$ for all $n \in \Num$.
We solve the recursive equation for $\Interval$ with $\Interval = \lambda f,a.\interval$,
where 
\[
\interval:\N,\N \rightarrow \alpha
\]
is a term in the context $(f:\N\rightarrow\N, a:\N)$ defined by 
\[
\interval 
\ \ \ = \ \ \ 
\lambda x.\cond (\base,  \lambda y.\inductive),
\]
where the base case and the inductive case are
\[
\base 
\ \ \ =\ \ \  
[\iter(x)]
\ \ \ =\ \ \ 
\cons(\iter(x),\nil)
\]
\[
\inductive 
\ \ \ = \ \ \ 
\iter(x) @ \interval(\Succ(x))(y)
\ \ \ = \ \ \  
\cons(\ \iter(x), \ \interval(\Succ(x))(y) \ )
\]
\end{Eg}

\begin{proposition}
$\Interval \in \Reg \cap \WTyped \cap \GTC = \CTlambda$.
\end{proposition}

%\begin{proof}
%The term $\Interval$ is well-typed and regular by definition. We check the global trace condition.
%Any infinite path $\pi$ either moves to $\iter$, for which we already checked the global trace condition,
%or cyclically moves from $\interval$ to $\interval$.
%We follow the unique infinite 
%trace $\tau$ of the last unnamed argument $\N$ of $\Interval$ inside this infinite path.
%The trace $\tau$ moves to the last unnamed argument $\N$ of  
%$\interval:\N,\N \rightarrow \N$, then to the last unnamed argument of
%$\cond (\ [\iter(x)],  \  \lambda y.\iter(x) @ (\lambda x.\interval)(\Succ(x))(y) \ )$.
%In this step $\tau$ progresses, and moves to 
%the first unnamed argument of $\lambda y.\iter(x) @ (\lambda x.\interval)(\Succ(x))(y) \ )$,
%then to $y:\N$ in the context of $\iter(x) @ (\lambda x.\interval)(\Succ(x))(y) \ )$.
%After one $\apvar$ rule, the trace $\tau$ reaches the unique unnamed argument of 
%$(\lambda x.\interval)(\Succ(x))$, then the last unnamed argument $\tau$ of $\interval$. 
%From $\interval$ the trace $\tau$ loops. Each time $\tau$ moves from $\interval$ to $\interval$
%then $\tau$ progresses once. We conclude that $\tau$ infinitely progresses.
%\end{proof}
%14:27 24/04/2024

The proof above includes a type inference from the term $\interval$ to itself.
We draw the type inference in the figure \ref{figure-term-interval}
and we outline the unique infinite trace. 
In this figure, we include a back edge from the 
$\golddagger$ on the top to the $\golddagger$ in the bottom.
We mark $\goldspadesuit$ the only progress point, which is cyclically repeated in 
the unique infinite trace.

The term $\Interval$ is an example of how difficult is to completely normalize
an infinite term. We have infinitely many nested $\beta$-reduction $(\lambda x. 
\ldots)(\Succ (x))$. Suppose we remove all of them in a single step. Inside the $
\beta$-redex number $k$ we obtain a sub-term $\iter[\Succ (x)/x]\ldots[\Succ (x)/x]
$ (substitution repeated $k$ times). The result is $\iter[\Succ ^k(x)/x] $.
The nested substitution produce infinitely many pairwise different sub-terms 
$\iter(\Succ ^k(x))$ for all $k \in \N$. We need $k$ steps to normalize each $
\iter(\Succ ^k(x))$ to $f^k(I)$, even if we allow to reduce infinitely many $\beta,
\cond$-redexes at the same time, because our reduction will consume one $\Succ$ 
at the time. Thus, the total time is infinite. Besides, the normal form we obtain in 
this way not regular: it contains all terms $f^k(\iter(x))$ for $k \in \N$, hence 
infinitely many pairwise different terms. 
%These infinite sub-terms are of a particulary simple form, though. 
%They are obtained by the repeating $k$ times the assignment $z:=f(z)$, then applying $z:=I$ once
%to the result.

%In conclusion, $\Interval$ is some term of $\CTlambda$ which can be safely 
%normalized, but which cannot be fully normalized in finite time, not even if we 
%allow infinite parallel reductions without any "safety" restriction. The normal form 
%is produced \emph{only in the limit} and it is \emph{not regular}. If we allow to 
%reduce infinitely many nested existing $\beta$-redexes in one step, also the 
%intermediate steps of the infinite reduction of $\Interval$ are not regular.
