\begin{abstract} 
Circular syntaxes for infinitary lambda-terms
were considered for instance by Ariola, Bl\"{o}m, Klop, Kennaway, Sleep, de Vries.
They allow to intepret lambda-terms written in fixed-point style 
as recursive definitions of infinitary terms. 
%In this way, circular syntax provides an 
%interpretation for basic constructions of functional programs, 
%like the letrec or mu of Clemens Grabmayer, Jan Rochel.
A sufficient, decidable and quite broad condition for reducing such 
infinitary lambda-terms to a numeral can be obtained
by adapting the global trace condition (GTC) to simply typed 
circular lambda-terms with conditional operator. 
GTC was originally proposed by J. Brotherston and A. Simpson
as a correctness condition for infinitary proofs.
Several people, including Das, Kuperberg, Pinault, Pous,
proved that GTC implies normalization to a numeral:
this result holds for a wide set of reductions and for closed circular lambda-terms 
with the type N of natural numbers. 

These papers considered a proper subset of infinitary lambda-terms, those
obtained from variables and combinators using a possibly infinite number of application.
Namely, these papers consider no \emph{explicit} clauses for lambda-abstraction,
which is instead defined through combinators.
Our contribuition is to add explicit clauses for lambda-abstraction
to the definition of GTC, and to check that 
the extended GTC retains the termination properties of the original GTC. 
%Namely, we prove that the extended GTC implies normalization to some numeral, 
%for all closed infinitary terms of type N and
%for all reductions sequences not reducing inside the 
%predecessor clause for the conditional operator.
