\begin{abstract} 
A motivation for having a circular syntax for G\"{o}del System {\em T} 
is that terms in a circular syntax are written in fixed point style, therefore are more 
familiar and shorter than the equivalent terms written in {\em T}, yet their 
totality can be checked mechanically. Several circular syntax for {\em T} (that 
is, infinite regular terms with the global trace condition)
have been proposed,
%, like $\CT$ by Anupam (\cite{2021-Anupam-Das}, \S 4.5, page 20), 
but without an explicit use of lambda-abstraction.
In this paper, we explore the possibility of defining a circular syntax 
directly for lambda-abstraction and simple types. %, which we call $\CTlambda$.
%, instead of interpreting
% $\lambda$-abstraction through combinators first, then inserting a  global trace condition afterwards.
%A circular syntax using binders instead of combinators
%could be more familiar for researchers working in the field of Type Theory.
%Again for reason of simplicity of use, we drop the restriction of having finitely many variables in infinite terms, 
%and finitely many redexes, a restriction considered in previous works on the same topic, 
%and we explore the consequences of this choice.
%\\
%In $\CTlambda$ 
We can define by simultaneous recursion 
finitely many terms using the terms themselves as proper subterms. Each time we
unfold the recursive definition we automatically 
remove all variables no more in use, to prevent an infinite proliferation of names.
We prove for our calculus:
\emph{(i)}  every closed term of the type of naturals reduces to some numeral;
\emph{(ii)}  strong normalization for all reductions sequences never reducing inside a fixed point operator; 
%A consequence of the
% fact that we allow infinitely many variables for our infinite terms is that some other results proved by Anupam,
%namely Strong Normalization for all reductions and Church Rosser 
%(\cite{2021-Anupam-Das}, Theorem 51, page 35), fail. 
%However, we recover for $\CTlambda$
\emph{(iii)} the existence of a limit for all infinite reductions.

\begin{abstract} 

A motivation for having a circular syntax for G\"{o}del System
T is that terms in a circular syntax are written in fixed
point-style, therefore are more natural and shorter than the
equivalent terms written in T, yet their totality can be
checked mechanically. Several circular syntax for T (that is,
infinite regular terms with the global trace condition) have been
proposed, like CT in the section 4.5 on the page 20
of the paper by Das in 2021, but without an explicit use of lambda-abstraction.  In this
paper we explore the possibility of defining a circular syntax
directly for lambda-abstraction and simple types, which we call
CT-lambda.  
%, instead of interpreting
% lambda-abstraction through combinators first, then inserting aglobal trace condition afterwards.
%A circular syntax using binders instead of combinators
%could be more familiar for researchers working in the field of Type Theory.  
%Again for reason of simplicity of use, we drop the restriction of having finitely many variables in infinite terms, 
%and finitely many redexes, a restriction considered in previous works on the same topic, 
%and we explore the consequences of ths choice.  
%\\
 We introduce our circular syntax as a fixed point operator defined by
cases through a test on $0$.  We prove for CT-lambda:
 \emph{(i)} every closed term of type $\N$ reduces to some numeral;
 \emph{(ii)} strong normalization for all reductions sequences without
reducing inside a fixed point operator; 
%A consequence of the 
% fact that we allow infinitely many variables for our infinite terms is that some other results proved by Anupam, 
%namely Strong Normalization for all reductions and Church Rosser 
%(\cite{2021-Anupam-Das}, Theorem 51, page 35), fail.  
%However, we recover for CT-lambda
 \emph{(iii)} the existence of a limit for all infinite reductions.
