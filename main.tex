\begin{abstract} 
Circular syntax for G\"{o}del System {\em T} has the advantage
that terms are written in fixed point style, and therefore are closer to a real
program and shorter than the equivalent terms written in {\em T}. Yet, the 
totality of cyclic terms can be checked mechanically. 
Several circular syntax for {\em T} (which are infinite regular terms with the 
global trace condition) have been proposed, for instance by A. Das,
by adapting circular syntax for proofs by J. Brotherston and A. Simpson.
These circular syntax for {\em T} make no explicit use of lambda-abstraction.
In this paper, we explore the possibility of defining a circular syntax 
directly for lambda-abstraction and simple types. 
In our syntax, we can define by simultaneous recursion 
finitely many terms using the terms themselves as proper subterms. 
Each time we unfold the recursive definition we automatically 
remove all variables no more in use, to prevent an infinite proliferation of names.
We prove for our circular syntax:
\emph{(i)}  every closed term of the type of naturals reduces to some numeral;
\emph{(ii)}  strong normalization for all reductions sequences not reducing inside the predecessor clause for the conditional operator; 
%A consequence of the
% fact that we allow infinitely many variables for our infinite terms is that some other results proved by Anupam,
%namely Strong Normalization for all reductions and Church Rosser 
%(\cite{2021-Anupam-Das}, Theorem 51, page 35), fail. 
%However, we recover for $\CTlambda$
\emph{(iii)} the existence of a limit for all infinite reductions.
