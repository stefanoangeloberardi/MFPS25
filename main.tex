\begin{abstract} 
Circular syntax for infinitary lambda-terms 
(see for instance Ariola, Bl\"{o}m, Klop, Kennaway, Sleep, de Vries 
\cite{ARIOLA1997154,10.1007/BFb0014548,KENNAWAY199793}) 
allows to intepret terms written in fixed point style 
as recursive definitions of
infinitary lambda-terms. Circular syntax provides an 
interpretation for basic constructions of functional programs, 
like the letrec or mu of Clemens Grabmayer, Jan Rochel 
(\cite{Letrec,Letmu,JanRochelPhd2016}).
A sufficient, decidable and quite broad condition for normalization for such 
infinitary lambda-terms can be obtained
by adapting the Global Trace Condition in the case of simply typed 
circular lambda-terms with conditional operator. 
Global Trace Condition was
originally proposed by J. Brotherston and A. Simpson
(\cite{BrotherstonPhd2006,BrotherstonSimpson2011})
as a correctness condition for infinitary proofs.
Several people, including Das, Kuperberg, Pinault, Pous 
(\cite{2021-Anupam-Das,2021-Anupam-Das,DBLP:conf/fscd/000221,DBLP:conf/lics/Curzi022,DBLP:conf/csl/Curzi023,DBLP:conf/lics/Curzi023}), 
proved that Global Trace condition (GTC) implies normalization to a numeral 
for a wide set of reductions
and for closed circular lambda-terms with the type N of natural numbers. 
These papers considered 
a proper subset of infinitary lambda-terms, those
obtained from variables and combinators using a possibly infinite number of application.
Namely, in these papers GTC includes no \emph{explicit} clauses for binders
(yet, implicitly, binders can be obtained through combinators).

In this paper we add explicit clauses for lambda-abstraction
to the definition of GTC, and we check for 
the extended GTC retains the properties of the original GTC. 
Namely, the extended GTC implies:
\emph{(i)} normalization to some numeral, 
for all reductions sequences \emph{not reducing inside the 
predecessor clause for the conditional operator}, 
and for all closed terms of type N;
\emph{(ii)} the existence of a limit lambda-term \emph{with no undefined subterms}
for all possible infinite reductions on all terms.
